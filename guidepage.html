                You will be met with a customization screen where you pick and choose your style
            </li>
            <li>
                You will be granted a option to choose a class, later on you will be able to combine your class with another class.
            </li>
            <li>
                The classes are divided into groups A and B, and you can only mix classes from the opposite group, an example <br>would be Warrior with Aegis or Tempest Mage with Thief. You unlock your second class at level 5 and they combine at level 8.

        <p style="color: black;">
            Feel free to pick whatever class strikes your fancy, but BE CAREFUL, once you select your primary and secondary class this choice CANNOT <br>be undone. I strongly suggest that you all take a look at our discord before selecting your class, there we have explanatory guides and builds so<br> you can get a head start. As we have every guide for all combined classes at level 8.</p>
