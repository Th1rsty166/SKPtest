                You will be granted a option to choose a class, later on you will be able to combine your class with another class.

                The classes are divided into groups A and B, and you can only mix classes from the opposite group, an example <br>would be Warrior with Aegis or Tempest Mage with Thief. You unlock your second class at level 5 and they combine at level 8.
